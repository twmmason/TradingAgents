I am unable to retrieve news for GOOG for the past week using the `get_stock_news_openai` tool, as all attempts to fetch news for September 18th, 17th, and 16th, 2025, resulted in a `NotFoundError`. Without this information, I cannot provide a comprehensive report detailing recent company news, social media analysis, or sentiment data, which are crucial for the requested analysis. Therefore, I cannot continue with the report.
